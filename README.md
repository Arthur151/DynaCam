DynaCam contains **in-the-wild** RGB videos captured by dynamic cameras, including annotations like:  
 - **Camera poses:**.  
 - **3D human trajectories in global coordinates:**.  

DynaCam is introduced in CVPR 2023 paper [TRACE: Temporal Regression of 5D Avatars with Dynamic Cameras in 3D Environments]().
